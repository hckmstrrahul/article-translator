3. **Limited Reach**: Non-English speaking designers in India miss out on valuable learning resources
4. **Manual Translation**: Current process is time-consuming and expensive
5. **Fragmented Tools**: No unified solution for design-specific content translation and transliteration

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Indian designers who prefer reading in their native language and script
- **Secondary**: Design educators teaching in regional languages
- **Tertiary**: Design students in tier 2/3 cities with limited English proficiency

## 6. User Flows

### Primary Flow: Translate Article via URL
1. User enters Sarvam API key in header
2. User inputs article URL
3. System shows loading indicator while fetching
4. System fetches and displays article
5. User selects target language
6. System shows translation progress
7. System translates and applies transliteration
8. System displays result with native script

### Alternative Flow: Manual Text Translation
1. User enters API key in header
2. User clicks "paste text directly"
3. User pastes article content
4. User selects target language
5. System shows processing indicator
6. System translates and transliterates
7. System displays result

### Error Flows
- Invalid API key → Clear error message with instructions
- URL fetch failure → Suggest manual input option
- Translation failure → Display specific error and retry option
- Transliteration failure → Fallback to translation only
